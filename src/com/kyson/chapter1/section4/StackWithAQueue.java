 * 1.4.28 一个队列实现的栈。使用一个队列实现一个栈，使得每个栈操作所需的队列操作数量为线性级别。

 1.4.28 Stack with a queue. Implement a stack with a single queue so that each stack
 operations takes a linear number of queue operations. Hint : To delete an item,
 get all of the elements on the queue one at a time, and put them at the end,
 except for the last one which you should delete and return.
 (This solution is admittedly very inefficient.)
